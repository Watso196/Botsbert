    "He's so lucky! I'm jealous of him. I wish I had some of that luck when I was younger. Sometimes I wonder if he knows how valuable it is.",
    "He's so SASSY! It's fun, until he's mad at me...",
    "Hmmm, we could be better friends? I dunno how to make that happen though.",
    "Sometimes I wonder if he likes me or not? Then again, he kinda acts that way with everyone. I'm sure it's fine!"

    "If guilt burned calories, Al would be a skeleton too!",
    "Sometimes he looks around suddenly like someone said something to him, and then doesn't see anything... I think maybe he needs more attention! Or maybe more marbles...",
    "You mean the one who's broke but wants money but hates all of the rich people??? I dunno, no opinions there...",
    "That bastard shot me with an arrow! I'm glad he's good with a bow but COME ON!",
    "Al's been a good friend to me for the most part! He never yells at me, which I like.",

    "She's way better at making her smile less creepy now! Like, the practicing was AWFUL, but it's marginally better!",
    "I saw her notebook one time and it was full of weird drawings and short little entries. I thought it was cute!",
    "She\u2019s got the best poker face I\u2019ve ever seen. Then again, I've never seen her play poker! Do you think Zhujesk knows poker??",
    "I REALLY want to know what the name of her Sea Monster is... Do you think it's, like, Todd?",
    "Sometimes I want to give her a hug, but then I remember she has scales and I'm just too sensitive for that... Oh also, I don't have a body!!!",

    "I think she might really like Thud... But I also think she'll never say anything...",
    "Oh my GODS, I can't wait for her to go on her date with Apikai! Droo calls him a 'beefcake'. I don't think I'd like a cake made of beef... But that makes sense because Droo would!",
    "Droo's my best friend! I can't gossip about her!!!",
    "Oh, Droo's been mentoring me! I'm not very good yet but she's patient and isn't hitting me with a wand all the time!"

    "Riva doesn\u2019t talk much, but when she does, usually it's about 'taking down capitalism', whatever that means!",
    "She\u2019s got a god-turtle sending her messages. Lucky! I used to get mine from a tempermental wizard. What does 'tempermental' mean?",
    "Riva can turn into SO MANY THINGS now. Sometimes I look at a bird on the ship and wonder.... is it her???",

  "matriarch": [
    "You mean the FACE TOUCHER? Hate her guts. If I were offered guts I'd say, 'These aren't the Matriarch's guts, are they?' And if they were I'd say, 'EW!' and smack them away with my mage hand!",
    "Do you think... She has a pet pig but he's evil???",
    "She has sisters - according to Oliver all sisters are evil, so THAT must be why she hates people so much!",
    "Can you explain to me what a 'coven' is again???",
    "I think the Matriarch was scared of Dame. I don't really remember though!"
  ],
  "avalon": [
    "She\u2019s had a bad time. I think maybe she looks a little older now? Just in the eyes?? It's nice though! It suits her.",
    "Avalon and Gillian are a thing now. Droo pretends she doesn\u2019t care, but hoo boy, she does!",
    "She used to live above an inn. Now she lives rent-free in Droo\u2019s head! And rent-free on our boat!! We're so nice to give her multiple places to stay!!!",

  "gillian": [
    "Gilly\u2019s a really nice guy! I can't believe we almost fought him when we met! He could have DIED! Then I wouldn't have a new friend!",
    "Sometimes I think Gilly still thinks that his cult is right. He doesn't want to help them, but maybe he thinks someone needs to.",
    "He trusts Al like a puppy! It's cute. Sometimes I worry about it though. Al knows how to LIE!",
    "Gilly probably needs therapy... but we don't have time for that! He can figure it out between fights like the rest of us!"

    "Siofra is weird. Helpful! But still weird.",
    "Do you think her and Oliver will eventually get MARRIED??? I better be married before them!!!",

  ],
  "magic": [
    "Can someone please explain to me why magic is so common when people get it wrong all the time? Wait, that's just me??",
    "I like magic! It's fun! Until you turn your neighbor into a sheep and don't know how to turn him back and get chased out of the village for the fourth time because all you can do is turn people into sheep....",
    "Oh, I know a card trick! Would that be the 'magic' you're looking for?",
    "Hmmmm, I think magic might be dangerous???? A'ro used to say it was 'like a butter knife'. Dunno what she meant by that!"

    "The Adamases have always been shitty. I remember my granddad hating that our bloodlines were crossed!",
    "Could you explain to me again how mean people get to run SEVERAL ISLANDS? That doesn't seem fair!",

    "I'd love to have an apprentice someday! It would be fun to teach a little Osbert how to do magic.",

    "OH, my apprenticeship? It's going well thank you for asking. (I've always wanted to say that!! Hehehe)"
  ],
  "bertinelli": [

    "My family was nice... I think? They made sure I got the apprenticeship I always wanted!",
    "It seems like the Bertinelli family isn't as big as it used to be??? I remember my father being at a LOT of court meetings.",
    "Sometimes I wonder if my brother ever made it into the navy like he wanted to?? It would be nice to see him again...",
    "They always talked so much about fabric! Did you know quality cloth has a finer weave? Not that I've worn clothes in a long time... Except my pot hat! I don't think my father would approve of that."

  "dame": [
    "I guess she's rich??? Oh, Al is gonna HATE her!",

    "I always thought a 'dame' was a pretty lady. But if she's anything like the Matriarch.... they got the name wrong.",

    "So expensive. I tried to buy a napkin and went into debt! Never mind that I didn't have any money...",
    "They worship ONE god in Lakay Ou. One! What if he\u2019s on break? What then???",
    "Avalon\u2019s from there, right? Explains why she was so shocked by the look of Gwo'dlo.",
    "It\u2019s a beautiful place. Shame about the EGO that fills that place."
  ],
  "ambith": [
    "Ambith's paper is so expensive!! Any paper they make could be made into scrolls.",
    "Oh yeah, that place! We definitely didn\u2019t burn anything down in there...",
    "The Current has more control there than people think. I once saw a street performer disappear mid-juggle! Never trust juggling. It\u2019s a gateway crime.",
    "Ambith smells like ink, sawdust, and taxes."

  "empyrna": [
    "Quiet place! I think I was bored *and* traumatized there as a child!",

  "alcohol": [
    "I miss the *idea* of alcohol. The taste? The buzz? The bad decisions? Mostly the taste.",
    "Droo says it\u2019s poison. Al says it\u2019s therapy. I just know I used to like it!",
    "Alcohol makes people funnier! Or louder. Or sadder. Usually all three."
  ],
  "prodo": [
    "Hm, the name is familiar. I think A\u2019ro used to mutter that name while reading contracts...",
    "I think about him any time I read fine print! Not a good look for Prodo.",
    "I think Prodo and the hags get along because they both hate clarity."
  ],
  "thud": [
    "He says like three words a week! I don't know if I could have a conversation with him.",
    "Droo stares at Thud like he\u2019s a problem she *wants* to solve.",
    "Pretty sure Thud has punched a god. Or at least a demigod. Or a rock pretending to be one. Still impressive!",
    "I would NOT want to fight, Thud. Something tells me he would LITERALLY crush me."
